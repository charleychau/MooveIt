# MooveIt
Coming to you, from Group 6 of CEN 4725, is Moove It, an Android adaptation of the popular handheld game Bop It.

##What is Moove It?
Moove It is an Android application that is based off of the handheld game Bop It. Like the original game, users will hear a command and will have to perform 
the corresponding gesture within a certain amount of time to move on in the game, but we've added a fun farm theme. For example, if you hear the command "Herd the sheep!" 
then you'll have a couple of seconds to draw a circle on your screen to herd the sheep.
